# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The assignment is to use python and the pandas library to help evalute the testing for standardized tests across several school districts.  The scoreboard has notified us that there has been academic misconduct in the 9th grade at Thomas High School and that all that data should be scrubbed while still reporting the rest of the results.
